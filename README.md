Home Assistant Virtual Nuki Bridge
=
Run this on your Home Assistant instead of using [Nuki Bridge](https://nuki.io/en/bridge/).
> **WARNING** Work-in-progress. Unstable.

This project is a work-in-progress of running [dauden1184](https://github.com/dauden1184/) 's [RaspiNukiBridge](https://github.com/dauden1184/RaspiNukiBridge) as a Home Assistant Addon.

There's a similar effort [here](https://github.com/ftarolli/NukiBridgeAddon).
